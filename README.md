Simulation of tumor kinetics using mathematical models described in literature, specifically using Hori et al's regime as the first incarnation. This codebase creates a pipeline that 1) generates large arrays of data (eventually based on user input) and 2) simulates tumor growth and biomarker diffusion in a 3D space. This software is implemented via a combination of C++, OpenGL, and CUDA.

I will be posting setup tips and commands shortly.
